# 🛠️ Data_Science Section

This repository contains my collection of self-directed data science and machine learning tasks. Each notebook or script focuses on a specific skill, concept, or method. These exercises help me build and polish core knowledge before moving into larger portfolio projects.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Linear and Polynomial Regression
- ✅ Residuals and Model Evaluation (R², MSE)
- ✅ Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Standardization)
- ✅ Model Training & Fitting using `scikit-learn`
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis with `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`
- ✅ Train/test splits and basic model validation

## 💡 Purpose

To strengthen individual skills in isolation before applying them to real-world projects. This repo is a personal lab where I explore topics like bias-variance tradeoff, data scaling, and model tuning in small focused environments.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 Next Steps

These tasks are foundational for future projects such as:
- Logistic Regression & Classification Tasks
- End-to-end Data Pipelines
- Deployable Streamlit-based Models
