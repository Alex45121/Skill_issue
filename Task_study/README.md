# üß† Task Study

This folder contains a series of small Python tasks created as part of my ongoing practice to polish my programming fundamentals. Each script explores core concepts in Python programming such as functions, classes, lambda expressions, property decorators, and sorting logic.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Overview

- `Game_char.py`  
  Simulates a basic game character using object-oriented programming. Covers attributes, methods, and class-based behavior.

- `Quiz.py`  
  A simple quiz app that demonstrates input/output, conditionals, and logic-based flow in Python.

- `Lambda.py`  
  Contains lambda function exercises with a focus on compact function definitions and functional programming patterns.

- `Property_task.py`  
  An exercise on using `@property` decorators to manage getter/setter behavior in class-based design.

- `sorting_updating.py`  
  Demonstrates sorting algorithms and how to dynamically update data structures using built-in functions and control flow.

## üîç Purpose

This folder serves as a "sandbox" where I challenge myself with small, self-contained problems. The goal is to:
- Strengthen coding fluency in Python
- Improve my problem-solving approach
- Reinforce clean code practices

## üöß Future Additions

This collection may grow over time with additional tasks covering:
- File I/O
- Error handling
- Recursion
- Simple algorithms and data structures

## üí° Why this matters

Before diving deep into data science, AI, or software development projects, having strong fundamentals is key. This folder showcases my commitment to mastering the basics first.
